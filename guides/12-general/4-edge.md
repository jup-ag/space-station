## What is Edge?

Edge, or [edge.jup.ag](https://edge.jup.ag/), is Jupiter's innovation testing ground, designed for power users who want to experiment with cutting-edge tech before they are released on [jup.ag](https://jup.ag/).

On Edge, we ship our newest features for Spot and Perpetuals, let users try it out and give us feedback,    then we re-iterate and improve on the features before it lands into the production site.

## How to Access Edge

Anyone can access [edge.jup.ag](https://edge.jup.ag/) and help us out with testing. However, please note that the latest features are still in Beta and may not function perfectly as intended.

## How to Find New Features on Edge

Edge includes a changelog that highlight the latest features and additions, making it easy for you to see whatâ€™s new and available for testing.

The goal of Edge is to create a **continuous feedback loop**:

1. We add new features into the changelog
2. You try them out and tell us what you like/dislike
3. We reiterate and improve on the features

Your feedback is crucial in helping us improve Jupiter!
