Tokens that aren't verified are marked with a ⚠️ warning label, encouraging users to double-check mint addresses before trading. If you've created a token and want it verified on the Jupiter Ecosystem List, here's how you can do it step-by-step.

---

**Step 1: Visit the Submission Portal:**

Head over to [**catdetlist.jup.ag**](https://catdetlist.jup.ag/) to submit your token for review.

**Step 2: Ensure Your Project Meets the Requirements:**

To qualify for verification, your token must meet the following criteria:

- **Age:** At least 21 days old.
- **Daily Volume:** More than $10,000 in trading volume.
- **Market Cap:** Exceed $100,000.
- **Unique Metadata:** Ensure the token's symbol and name are unique and not duplicates of existing projects.
- **Unique Holders:** Have more than 500 unique holders.

:::warning Trade Without Verification
Your token doesn’t need to be verified to be tradable. Most new liquidity pools are supported for instant routing for 14 days. Afterward, pools are re-evaluated periodically.
