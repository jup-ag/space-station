The root URL of the Recurring API's deposit to a price-based order endpoint is as such.

```
https://api.jup.ag/recurring/v1/priceDeposit
```

:::info
As the price-based order is opened indefinitely until the user closes them, the user can deposit more funds into the order to continue executing.
:::

## Deposit Order

If you want to deposit funds into a price-based order, you need to do these steps:

1. Get a list of the order accounts you want to deposit via `/getRecurringOrders` endpoint.
2. Choose the order account to deposit by making a post request to the `/priceDeposit` endpoint to get the transaction to deposit into the order.
3. Sign then send the transaction to the network either via `/execute` endpoint or by yourself.

:::info Get Recurring Orders
[Refer to the `/getRecurringOrders` section](/docs/recurring-api/get-recurring-orders) to prepare the order account you want to deposit into.
:::

```jsx
const priceDepositResponse = await (
    await fetch('https://api.jup.ag/recurring/v1/priceDeposit', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            order: "EpTsCUnKComCd8FDNZn3kVrQBQo2uEn5rRzYk9ocqFPH",
            user: wallet.publicKey.toBase58(),
            amount: 1000000
        }),
    })
).json();
