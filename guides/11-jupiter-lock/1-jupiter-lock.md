2.1.	Jupiter Lock and Services

Jupiter Lock is a open-sourced, audited and free tool for users to lock and distribute their own digital assets over-time, allowing project teams to lock tokens, implement cliffs, and vest non-circulating supply in a clear and transparent manner. Jupiter Lock performs its core functions via interoperable smart contracts, functioning solely as a back-end technical tool allowing users to perform the above functions. 

2.2.	Peer-to-peer interactions
The Services facilitates peer-to-peer interactions between users (for example, between third party project teams which decide to utilise the Services to lock their tokens and the community members of such third party projects) and we are not a party to any such arrangements. Accordingly, you agree that we are not responsible for any activities between users accessing the Services, and you shall bear all risks (including civil claims or regulatory risk) of (a) all activities being performed by you in connection with any other user utilising the Services, and (b) all activities and interactions with other users.

4.	RISK FACTORS

You acknowledge and agree that the Services are is currently in the initial development stages and there are a variety of unforeseeable risks with utilising the Services or Website. In the worst scenario, this could lead to the loss of all or part of your digital assets associated with the Services. IF YOU DECIDE TO UTILISE SERVICES YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE, ACCEPT AND ASSUME THE BELOW RISKS AND AGREE NOT TO HOLD JUPITER LOCK OR ANY OF THEIR RELATED PARTIES RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FOLLOWING RISKS:

4.1.	Third-party Risk
The Services rely on whole or partly, on third-party open and closed source software networks, and the continued development and support of third parties. There is no assurance or guarantee that those third parties will maintain their support of their software, which might have a material adverse effect on the Services. Further, where digital assets are locked as collateral for applications built with Jupiter Lock tools and/or are deployed by such third party applications towards third-party decentralized finance protocols to further generate yield, a failure or security incident in respect of such third-party protocol may result in users losing all or substantially all of their digital assets.

4.2.	No Insurance
Digital assets are not legal tender, are not backed by the government, and are not subject to the Deposit Insurance Scheme or protections under any banking or securities laws. Jupiter Lock is not a bank and does not offer fiduciary services, nor does it offer any security broking services.

4.3.	New Technical Risk
The software used for Jupiter Lock is new. While this software has been extensively tested, the underlying smart contracts and software used for the Services is still relatively new and could have bugs or security vulnerabilities. Further, the software is still under development and may undergo significant changes over time that may not meet users’ expectations.

4.4.	Risks
The underlying smart contracts run on a variety of supported blockchain networks, using specially-developed smart contracts. Accordingly, upgrades to the relevant blockchain network, a hard fork in the relevant blockchain network, re-organisations of blockchain structure or blocks, or a change in how transactions are confirmed on the relevant blockchain network may have unintended, adverse effects on the smart contracts built thereon, including Jupiter Lock software and smart contracts.

4.5.	Information Security Risk
Digital assets, and use of the Services may be subject to expropriation and/or theft. Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the Services in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Furthermore, because the underlying blockchain networks comprise open-source software, there is the software underlying the Services may contain intentional or unintentional bugs or weaknesses that may negatively affect the Services or result in the loss of the user’s digital assets, the loss of the user’s ability to access or control their digital assets. In the event of such a software bug or weakness, there may be no remedy, and users are not guaranteed any remedy, refund or compensation.

4.6.	Regulatory risks
The regulatory status of digital assets, and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. While every effort has been taken to ensure that the Services are compliant with local laws, it is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulation with respect to the Services. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether legislatures or regulatory agencies may implement changes to law and regulation affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications, including the Services. Regulatory actions could negatively impact Jupiter Lock in various ways, and thus the Services may not be available in certain areas.

4.7.	Taxation Risk
The tax characterization of digital assets, and the usage of the Services are uncertain. It is possible that the user's intended treatment of digital assets may be challenged. You must seek your own tax advice in connection with the Services provided by Jupiter Lock, which may result in adverse tax consequences to you, including, without limitation, withholding taxes, transfer taxes, value-added taxes, income taxes and similar taxes, levies, duties or other charges and tax reporting requirements.

9.2.	Dispute Resolution
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT CONTAINS CERTAIN PROVISIONS, SUCH AS A BINDING ARBITRATION SECTION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER, WHICH AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. THIS SECTION REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH JUPITER LOCK AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.
Each party (i) waives all its respective right(s) to have any and all disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands or proceedings (collectively, "Disputes") arising from or related to these Terms resolved in a court, and (ii) waive all its respective right(s) to have any Disputes heard before a court. Instead, each party shall arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).

Any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms is personal to you and will be resolved solely through individual arbitration, and in no circumstances shall be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. There will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an entity attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.

Any Dispute arising out of or in connection with these Terms (including without limitation the enforceability of this section or any question regarding its existence, validity or termination) shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration administered by Panama Conciliation and Arbitration Centre in accordance with its procedural rules for the time being in force. The tribunal shall consist of 1 arbitrator. The language of the arbitration shall be English.

Each party will notify the other party in writing of any Dispute within thirty (30) days of the date it arises, so that the Parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute informally. Notice to Jupiter Lock shall be sent by e-mail to Jupiter Lock at legal@jup.ag. Notice to you shall be either posted on the Website or, if available, will be sent by email to your email on record. Your notice must include (i) your name, postal address, email address and telephone number, (ii) a full and sufficient description of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (iii) the specific relief that you are seeking. If you and Jupiter Lock cannot agree on how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date the notice is received by the applicable party, then either you or Jupiter Lock may, as appropriate and in accordance with this section, commence an arbitration proceeding or, to the extent specifically provided for in this section, file a claim in court.

The arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative or class action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.

If any term, clause or provision of this section is held invalid or unenforceable, it will be held to the minimum extent applicable and required by law, and all other terms, clauses and provisions of this section will remain valid and enforceable. Further, the waivers set forth in this section are severable from the other provisions of these Terms and will remain valid and enforceable, except as prohibited by applicable law.

You agree that this section of these Terms has been included to rapidly and inexpensively resolve any disputes with respect to the matters described herein, and that this section shall be grounds for dismissal of any court action commenced by you with respect to a dispute arising out of such matters.

A printed version of these Terms shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings.
