## Overview

Jupiter is one of the most widely integrated protocols, so a lot of work is involved in minimizing issues on new integrations and making each integration valuable to our users and partners.

Our top priority is securing the best prices and the best token selection for our users, so we will focus on DEXes that will bring the most benefits to them.

:::caution We do not charge fees for integration.

## Integration Prerequisites

As Solana grows and more DEXes are built, we have to be more cautious in the DEXes we integrate, we look into a variety of factors.

- **Code health**: It will help with integration and ensure maintainability in the future.
- **Security Audit**: This is important to ensure users' funds are secure and the program is not malicious.
- **Traction**: We look at the traction of the DEX to ensure it has market demand and is well-used.
- **Team and backers**: This is a good indicator of the quality of the DEX if they are backed by or built by reputable or verifiable entities.

## Integration Guidelines

### Markets API
- This API should track all markets/pools that is listed or delisted, this will allow us to automatically track new markets as you add them to your DEX.

### Rust SDK
- [Your SDK should implement the following interface](#).
- We are soon migrating to a Rust SDK and so are asking all integrated DEXes to create a Rust SDK version or give access to the code for us to include.

## AMM Interface

To facilitate integration of your DEX into the Jupiter Core Engine:
- Provide a DEX SDK that works with the [Jupiter AMM Interface](https://docs.rs/crate/jupiter-amm-interface).
- Enable us to fork your SDK, this ensures our users that we can guarantee maintenance, support for the SDK, and fix potential bugs related to integrated DEXs.

:::note
`get_accounts_to_update` provides the necessary accounts to fetch, they are batched and cached by the Jupiter Core Engine and delivered through `update` to the AMM instance, there might be multiple calls to `quote` using the same cache so **we do not allow any network calls** in the entire implementation.

:::info Resource and Support
You can refer to the implementation guide https://github.com/jup-ag/rust-amm-implementation for easier integration with Jupiter.
