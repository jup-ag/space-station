:::info
As of January 2025, you no longer need to use the Referral Program to set up a `referralAccount` and `referralTokenAccount` to collect fees from the swaps you provide to the end users.

Simply, just pass in any valid token account as the `feeAccount` parameter in the Swap API.
:::

:::note
You can still find information about the Referral Program.

The Referral Program is an open source program by Jupiter to provide referral fees for integrators who are integrating Jupiter Swap and Jupiter Limit Order. You can check out the code [here](https://github.com/TeamRaccoons/referral) to gain a better understanding of how it works.
:::

## Use Case

By default, there are **zero** protocol fees on Jupiter Swap. Integrators have the option to introduce a platform fee denoted in basis points, e.g. **20 bps** for **0.2%** of the token input or output.

:::note
If you use our APIs heavily and consider taking fees, [please reach out to us](https://t.me/Yankee0x).

### Important Notes

- This is useful if you are an end user application such as wallets, payments, merchants, etc.
- It does not support Token2022 tokens.
- Referral Program is no longer required.

### Important Notes
- The Jupiter Swap project account for the Referral Program is `45ruCyfdRkWpRNGEqWzjCiXRHkZs8WXCLQ67Pnpye7Hp`.
- The `referralTokenAccount` can either be:
    - **Input mint or the output mint** on the swap for ExactIn.
    - **Input mint ONLY** on the swap for ExactOut.
- You can use the [Dashboard](https://referral.jup.ag/dashboard), [SDK](https://github.com/TeamRaccoons/referral/blob/main/example/src/createReferralAccount.ts) or [API](https://referral.jup.ag/api) to set up the `referralAccount` and `referralTokenAccount` in this guide.

## Let’s Get Started

### 1. Set up

You will need to complete the prerequisites and understanding of [Environment Setup](/docs/environment-setup) and [Get Quote and Swap](1-get-quote.md) guide as this is reliant on the Swap API.

**Obtain `referralAccount` and `referralTokenAccount`**

There are 3 ways you can set up a referral account.

1. Use our [referral dashboard](https://referral.jup.ag/dashboard) to create them. After creating, remember to find your `Referral Key` on the page and the associated token accounts.
2. Use our SDK to create them. You can use the [example scripts](https://github.com/TeamRaccoons/referral/tree/main/example/src) to create.
3. Use our API to create them. You can use this [API reference](https://referral.jup.ag/api) to create.

**Obtain `mintAccount`**

As for the mint account, assuming you have an interface where a user swaps, you will know up front what are the input or output mints. For the sake of example, we will use a hardcoded mint public key.

```jsx
const referralAccount = new Publickey('ReplaceWithPubkey');
const mintAccount = new Publickey('So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112');
```

### 2. Set your referral fee in Quote

Setting your referral fee is simple, just add `platformFeeBps` parameter to the `/quote` endpoint.

In this example, we set `platformFeeBps` to `20` which equates to 0.2%.

```jsx
const quoteResponse = await (
    await fetch(
        'https://api.jup.ag/swap/v1/quote?inputMint=So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112&outputMint=EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v&amount=100000&slippageBps=50&restrictIntermediateTokens=true&platformFeeBps=20'
    )
  ).json();
  
console.log(JSON.stringify(quoteResponse, null, 2));
```

### 3. Set your referral token account in Swap

In order to refer and receive fees from all types of tokens, you will need to have already initialize `referralTokenAccount`s (owned by your `referralAccount`) for the mint in the swap. By calling the Swap API with the parameter `feeAccount`, which is the `referralTokenAccount`, you will receive the serialized swap transaction that will set a fee to be taken from the referred and sent to that token account.

In this code block, we will be using the SDK to try to find the `referralTokenAccount` based on our previously defined `referralAccount` and `mintAccount`.
- If the token account is found, it will proceed to the Swap API.
- If the token account is not found, it will send a transaction to the network to attempt to initialize one for the mint. **Do note that transactions may fail due to various reasons like Priority Fees.**

```jsx
import { ReferralProvider } from "@jup-ag/referral-sdk";

const { tx, referralTokenAccountPubKey } = await provider.initializeReferralTokenAccount({
    payerPubKey: wallet.publicKey,
    referralAccountPubKey: referralAccount,
    mint: mintAccount,
});

const referralTokenAccount = await connection.getAccountInfo(referralTokenAccountPubKey);

// Attempt to initialize a token account
if (!referralTokenAccount) {
    const signature = await sendAndConfirmTransaction(connection, tx, [wallet]);
    console.log({ signature, referralTokenAccountPubKey: referralTokenAccountPubKey.toBase58() });

// Since initialized, it will carry on
} else {
    console.log(`referralTokenAccount ${referralTokenAccountPubKey.toBase58()} for mint ${mintAccount.toBase58()} already exists`);
};

const feeAccount = referralTokenAccountPubKey;
console.log(feeAccount);
```

However, if you are confident that the `referralTokenAccount` for specific mints have been created, you can use this method to get it. **Do note that, even if the token account is not intialized, it will return a pubkey as it is a Program Derived Address. [Read more here.](https://solana.com/docs/core/pda#findprogramaddress)**

```jsx
const [feeAccount] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(
    [
        Buffer.from("referral_ata"), // A string that signifies the account type, here "referral_ata."
        referralAccount.toBuffer(), //  The public key of the referral account converted into a buffer.
        mintAccount.toBuffer(), // The mint public key, converted into a buffer.
    ],
    new PublicKey("REFER4ZgmyYx9c6He5XfaTMiGfdLwRnkV4RPp9t9iF3") // The public key of the Referral Program
);
```

Using the above, we will now know the `feeAccount` to be passed in as the parameter in Swap API. You can refer to the [Build Swap Transaction](2-build-swap-transaction.md) guide to add any parameters where necessary to help transaction sending, etc.

```jsx
const swapResponse = await (
    await fetch('https://api.jup.ag/swap/v1/swap', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            quoteResponse,
            userPublicKey: wallet.publicKey.toBase58(), // Pass in actual referred user in production
            feeAccount: feeAccount,
        })
    })
).json();

console.log(swapResponse);
```

</details>

### 1. Set up

You will need to complete the prerequisites and understanding of [Environment Setup](/docs/environment-setup) and [Get Quote and Swap](1-get-quote.md) guide as this is reliant on the Swap API.

### 2. Set your fee in Quote

Setting your fee is simple, just add `platformFeeBps` parameter to the `/quote` endpoint.

In this example, we set `platformFeeBps` to `20` which equates to 0.2%.

```jsx
const quoteResponse = await (
    await fetch(
        'https://api.jup.ag/swap/v1/quote?inputMint=So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112&outputMint=EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v&amount=100000&slippageBps=50&restrictIntermediateTokens=true&platformFeeBps=20'
    )
  ).json();
  
console.log(JSON.stringify(quoteResponse, null, 2));
```

### 3. Set your feeAccount in Swap

In the `/swap` endpoint, you will need to pass in the `feeAccount` parameter. The `feeAccount` is any token account that will receive the fees from the swap. Do ensure that the token account is initialized and is the correct mint to receive the fees in.

```jsx
const swapResponse = await (
    await fetch('https://api.jup.ag/swap/v1/swap', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            quoteResponse,
            userPublicKey: wallet.publicKey.toBase58(), // Pass in actual referred user in production
            feeAccount: feeAccount,
        })
    })
).json();
```

### 4. Sign and send transaction

Finally, the user can sign the transaction and it can be submitted to the network to be executed. You can refer to the [Send Swap Transaction](3-send-swap-transaction.md) guide to complete this step.
