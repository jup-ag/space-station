## Features

### Ape Account Program

- **Seamless Logins**: Both social logins and Web3 methods are supported; Goodbye seed phrases.
- **Secure Accounts**: ApePro uses Multiparty Computation (MPC) for securing accounts, ensuring security without compromising usability.
- **Smart Wallet Program**: ApePro operates on a proprietary Solana program, which differs from your typical Externally Owned Account (EOA) that you access via wallet providers like Phantom and Solflare. The ApePro program allows the platform to implement advanced functionalities such as instant signless transactions, intelligent fee optimisations and automatic transaction retries. While you own the private key, the platform is currently restricting access to exporting the private key as current wallet providers like Phantom and Solflare do not support this, and this otherwise will cause more user confusion

- **Withdrawals**: Ape currently only supports withdrawal of SOL and not other tokens
