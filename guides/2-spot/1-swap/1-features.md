Solana was built with trading in mind with its blazing speed and affordable transaction fees, resulting in thousands of new tokens and markets being spawned and new use cases and concepts being birthed. 

Our goal at Jupiter is to provide a seamless experience as your Everyday Exchange. As the Everyday Exchange, you can:

### Access best-priced tokens, quickly.

You can find newly launched tokens with our Instant Routing feature. New tokens & markets are automatically added to Jupiter Routing.

Access these tokens at best prices with our performant routing engine, [Metis](./3-how-swap-works.md). We perform the math and give you best prices at Solana speed, at 0 protocol fees.

### Access the right tokens, safely. 

You see all important token information (metadata, authorities, verification) and trade conditions such as price impact to help you make an informed swap decision.

Within Search, we also filter out imposter tokens and duplicates, utilise [community verification](https://catdetlist.jup.ag/) of tokens, and intelligent search using real-time info (liquidity, volume).

### Trade frictionlessly, knowing it just works.

You get an abstracted swap experience with Auto mode by setting your Max Slippage and MEV protection. Jupiter will do the rest by configuring the best transaction fees and slippage based on your trade, heuristics, and market conditions. 

For folks who wants more fine-tuned control e.g. choosing Fixed Slippage to [Dynamic Slippage](./3-how-swap-works.md), we have Manual mode for you.
