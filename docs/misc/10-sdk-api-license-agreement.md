**IMPORTANT:** This Jupiter API & SDK License Agreement ("Agreement") is a legally binding contract between you, as Licensee ("You", "Your" or "Licensee") and Block Raccoon S.A., an entity incorporated in Panama ("Jupiter," "we" or "our") and applies to your use of the Jupiter API or SDK, as defined herein, available through https://portal.jup.ag (collectively the "Service"). The Service includes an Application Programming Interface ("API") and a Software Development Kit (“SDK”), which is further discussed and defined below. If you do not agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, please do not proceed with the use of Service, the API, or the SDK.

This Agreement becomes effective as of the date you first access, download, copy or otherwise use the API or SDK ("Effective Date"). This Agreement shall continue until terminated either by us or by you. Even after termination of this Agreement, certain provisions will survive, as discussed herein. This Agreement also incorporates Jupiter`s Terms of Service link and Privacy Policy link which terms shall also govern your use of the Service. In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy, the provisions of this Agreement shall prevail.

YOU ARE ENTERING A LEGALLY BINDING CONTRACT: BY COPYING, DOWNLOADING, OR OTHERWISE USING THE JUPITER API OR SDK YOU ARE EXPRESSLY AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY ALL TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO COPY, DOWNLOAD, INSTALL OR OTHERWISE USE THE JUPITER API or SDK.

The API and SDK are protected by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. The API and SDK is licensed to you, and its use is subject to the terms of this Agreement.

**1. Definitions​**

1.1 **"Application Programming Interfaces"** or **"API"** or **“Jupiter API”** means the back-end smart routing algorithm which facilitates the user’s efficient swapping of digital assets at a variety of third party trading venues, which may include object code, software libraries, software tools, sample source code, published specifications and Documentation. Jupiter API shall include any future, updated or otherwise modified version(s) thereof furnished by Jupiter (in its sole discretion) to Licensee.

1.2 **"Software Development Kit"** or **“SDK”** or **“Jupiter SDK”** means the ancillary tools and resources that allow the user to utilise or integrate the API. Jupiter SDK shall include any future, updated or otherwise modified version(s) thereof furnished by Jupiter (in its sole discretion) to Licensee.

1.3 **"Documentation"** includes, but is not limited to programmer guides, manuals, materials, and information appropriate or necessary for use in connection with the API.

**2. Grant of License​**

2.1 Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Jupiter hereby grants Licensee a limited, non-exclusive, fee-bearing, non-transferable, non-sublicensable licence to use the API or SDK during the term of this Agreement solely for the purpose of Licensee's internal development efforts to develop products or services integrating the API and/or SDK in any manner (the **Licensee’s Product**).

2.2 Licensee shall have no right to distribute, license (whether or not through multiple tiers) or otherwise transfer the API or SDK to any third party.

2.3 In case of potential other API or SDK use that is not prescribed by this Agreement, please write to info@jup.ag to seek written consent.

2.4 Representations. Both Parties to this Agreement are duly organized and validly existing in good standing with all requisite power and authority to enter into this Agreement and conduct its business as is now being conducted.

Where the Licensee fails to accept such updates or upgrades, Jupiter shall be entitled to withhold access to the API, SDK and/or Service, and the same shall not constitute any breach of the terms of this Agreement.

**4. Intellectual Property and proprietary rights**

4.1 As between Jupiter and Licensee, Jupiter and/or its licensors shall own and retain all proprietary rights, including all patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark and other intellectual property rights, in and to the API and SDK and any corrections, bug fixes, enhancements, updates, improvements, or modifications thereto and (to the extent such rights accrue to the Licensee), the Licensee hereby irrevocably transfers, conveys and assigns to Jupiter all of its right, title, and interest therein.

4.2 Jupiter shall have the exclusive right to apply for or register any patents, mask work rights, copyrights, and such other proprietary protections with respect thereto.

4.4 The Parties acknowledge that Jupiter does not store, send, or receive digital assets. Digital assets exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on the relevant blockchain network. Any creation or transfer of title that might occur in respect of any digital asset occurs on the relevant blockchain network (on the relevant contractual terms applicable to such creation and/or transfer) and is performed by the Licensee’s Product, and Jupiter does not have any role or responsibility in such transactions. Jupiter cannot guarantee that the Licensee’s Product, or any party can effect the transfer of such title or right to any digital asset. Accordingly, Jupiter cannot provide any guarantee, warranty or assurance regarding the authenticity, uniqueness, originality, quality, marketability, legality or value of any digital assets utilised in connection with the API and the Services.

**5. No Obligation to Support​**

5.1 Subject to payment of fees as described herein, Jupiter would issue to the Licensee certain unique API keys, tokens, passwords and/or other credentials (collectively, **"Keys"**), for accessing the API and/or SDK and managing the Licensee's access to the API. The Licensee may only access the API with the Keys issued to the Licensee by Jupiter. The Licensee acknowledges that access to the API may not always be available. The Licensee may not sell, transfer, sublicense or otherwise disclose its Keys to any other party or use them for any other purpose other than that expressly permitted by Jupiter. The Licensee is responsible for maintaining the secrecy and security of the Keys. The Licensee is fully responsible for all activities that occur using the Keys, regardless of whether such activities are undertaken by the Licensee or a third party. The Licensee is responsible for maintaining up-to-date and accurate information (including a current email address and other required contact information) for the Licensee's access to the API and SFK. Jupiter may discontinue the Licensee's access to the API and SDK if such contact information is not up-to-date and/or the Licensee does not respond to communications directed to such coordinates.

Judgment upon the award may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof or having jurisdiction over the relevant party or its assets. Jupiter and the Licensee will each pay their respective attorneys’ fees and expenses. Any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement is personal to the Licensee and Jupiter and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action, or any other type of representative proceeding. There will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which a person attempts to resolve a dispute as a representative of another person or group of persons. Further, a dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other person or group of persons.
