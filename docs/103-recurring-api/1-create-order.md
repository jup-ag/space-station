The root URL of the Recurring API's create order endpoint is as such.

```
https://api.jup.ag/recurring/v1/createOrder
```

## Create Order

This is a POST request to `/createOrder` endpoint, where you pass in the necessary parameters and our backend will create the transaction for you to sign and send to the network seamlessly.

:::info
The Recurring API supports both Time-based and Price-based strategies.

The `createOrder` endpoint is used to create both types of orders based on the parameters you pass in.
:::

### Time-based Order

Pass in the **`time`** object in the `params` field.

:::note
Some notes to help you understand the parameters.

- The amount to be spent per cycle is calculated based on your input amount and the total number of orders.
```
Amount to be spent per cycle = inAmount / totalOrders
e.g. 100 USDC / 10 orders = 10 USDC per order
```

- The total time to complete is definite as the amount to be spent per cycle is fixed.
```
Total time to complete = totalOrders * cycleFrequency
e.g. 10 orders * 86_400 seconds = 864_000 seconds = 10 days
```
:::

```jsx
const createOrderResponse = await (
    await fetch('https://api.jup.ag/recurring/v1/createOrder', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            user: wallet.publicKey.toBase58(),
            inputMint: "So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112",
            outputMint: "EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v",
            params: {
                time: {
                    inAmount: 200000000, // Raw amount of input token to deposit now (before decimals)
                    numberOfOrders: 10, // Total number of orders to execute
                    cycleFrequency: 300, // Cycle frequency in unix seconds
                    minPrice: null, // Minimum price or null
                    maxPrice: null, // Maximum price or null
                    startAt: null, // Unix timestamp of start time or null - null starts immediately
                },
            },
        }),
    })
).json();
```

### Price-based Order

Pass in the **`price`** object in the `params` field.

:::note
Some notes to help you understand the parameters.

- Price-based orders are opened indefinitely until the user closes them.
- Once low on funds, the order will not be closed and can continue to execute if the user deposits more into the order. Refer to the [Deposit Price Order](/docs/recurring-api/deposit-price-order) endpoint to deposit more funds into the order.
- Alternatively, the user can also withdraw funds from the order without closing it. Refer to the [Withdraw Price Order](/docs/recurring-api/withdraw-price-order) endpoint to withdraw funds from the order.
- The total time to use up all funds is not definite as the amount to be spent per cycle is variable based on the USDC value of the input token.
:::

```jsx
const createOrderResponse = await (
    await fetch('https://api.jup.ag/recurring/v1/createOrder', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            user: wallet.publicKey.toBase58(),
            inputMint: "So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112",
            outputMint: "EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v",
            params: {
                price: {
                    depositAmount: 200000000, // Raw amount of input token to deposit now (before decimals)
                    incrementUsdcValue: 1000000, // Raw amount of USDC value to increment per cycle (before decimals)
                    orderInterval: 300, // Cycle frequency in unix seconds
                    startAt: null, // Unix timestamp of start time or null - null starts immediately
                },
            },
        }),
    })
).json();
```

Now that you have the order transaction, you can sign and send to the network. There are 2 methods, after signing the transaction, you can either send it to the network yourself or use the Recurring API's `/execute` endpoint to do it for you.

[Let's execute the order](/docs/recurring-api/execute-order)!

## Create Order Response

The response from the `createOrder` endpoint is as follows.

:::info
Do note that both recurring and smart recurring orders will return the same response structure.
