The purpose of Active Staking Rewards (also known as ASR) is an innovative experiment to create an extremely vibrant and virtuous cycle where active Jupiter voters gain increasing amounts of voting power early on - the more active you are in the process, ideally the more you will benefit.

## About ASR

We want Jupiter DAO to become the best DAO in crypto and at the core of it, is an extremely active, distributed and involved voter base.

We developed a mechanism called ASR with these key objectives:
- **Active Staking:** Reward stakers who actively participate through voting and most importantly, engage.
- **Committed Voters:** ASRs are not meant to get people to lock their tokens but instead focused on growing a committed pool of voters to make key decisions together.
- **Simplicity:** Keeping it as simple as possible was key in onboarding a large userbase, as a majority of JUP holders are participating in governance for the first time.

## The First ASR

In the first quarter, there were a total of 9 proposals, 3 of which are Trial Working Group proposals where each of its rewards are ⅓ of a proposal ([read more](https://www.jupresear.ch/t/trial-budgets-for-the-3-new-wgs/15976)).

After the first quarter since the genesis of JUP and the Jupiter DAO, we conducted the very first ASR distribution in July. The ASR consists of 5 different tokens that were allocated during their respective LFG Launches: JUP, WEN, ZEUS, SHARK, UPT. The JUP token is part of ASR as JUP was launched on the LFG Launchpad as well, the fees generated from it was given to the DAO to redistribute in ASR - giving our active voters more voting power.

## ASR Distribution Methodology

Each proposal (other than the 3 Trial WGs proposals) are allocated the same amount of total rewards, while the Trial WG proposals got ⅓ of those rewards.

|| JUP | WEN | ZEUS | SHARK | UPT |
| -------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | --------- | ----------------| ----------|
|Total ASR Pool                    |50,000,000   |7,500,000    |750,000    |7,500,000,000    |750,000    |
|Reward Pool per Proposal          |7,142,857.14 |1,071,428.57 |107,142.86 |1,071,428,571.43 |107,142.86 |
|Reward Pool for Trial WG Proposal |2,380,952.38 |357,142.86   |35,714.29  |357,142,857.14   |35,714.29  |

We calculated ASR based on a **Per Proposal Methodology**:

- **Determine voting activity:** We look at which proposals you voted in and how much voting power you voted with.
- **Calculating reward rates:** Based on the total voting power of each proposal, we calculate the reward rate using the reward pool per proposal.
- **Calculating user rewards:** Based on the reward rates and your voting power of each proposal, we calculate how much rewards of each token you are allocated per proposal.

## Future ASR

ASR was initially bootstrapped with 100M JUP (50M distributed in July's ASR) from the LFG Launchpad fee, and will last over 2 quarters. Renewing ASR beyond these 2 quarters would be the crucial ASR vote coming up in early August. This would fund ASR for a longer period, after the 100M JUP has been entirely distributed.

We will be introducing a minimum of 10 JUP staked to be eligible for future ASR - ensuring that more tokens goes towards dedicated and active voters.
