[Get Started!](./)
:::

## Step 1: Pick Your Tokens

Now, let’s set up your trade:

1. In the **From** field, select the token you want to sell or trade.

    - Use the dropdown menu or search for the token name.

2. In the **To** field, select the token you want to buy or receive.

:::caution
It is always a good habit to use the token's mint address as the source of truth.

If you use the name or symbol/ticker to search for the token, always cross reference the mint address.

## Step 2: Enter the Amount

Enter how much of the token you want to sell in the **From** field. Jupiter will instantly calculate and reflect on the interface:

- **Output Amounts:** How much you’ll get back.

    1. The total output amount of the swap
    2. The minimum output amount (after accounting for slippage) of the swap

- **Route Details:** Jupiter's GPS for your tokens.

    You can find and open the **1 Market** or **2 Routes + 2 Markets** above the Swap Button. It will show you the exact order routing path for the quote.

You’ll also see some handy details which can help you make informed decisions:

- **Price Impact:** Price Impact is influenced by the available liquidity to settle the trade. The larger the trade the larger the price impact on the selected assets.
